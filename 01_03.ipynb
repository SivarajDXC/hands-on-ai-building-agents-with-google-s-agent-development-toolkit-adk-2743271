    "# Here's what you've achieved:\n",
    "# Environment Setup: You've installed ADK and configured your environment to work with the Gemini model.\n",
    "# Modular Design: You created a reusable function (run_adk_agent_interaction) to simplify agent invocations. This is a crucial step towards building complex multi-agent systems.\n",
    "# Agent Definition: You defined an Agent and precisely controlled its behavior using the instruction parameter.\n",
    "# Agent Interaction: You successfully sent various inputs to your agent and observed its responses, demonstrating its multilingual capability and adherence to its core instruction.\n",
    "# This foundation prepares you for more advanced ADK concepts, such as integrating tools, managing complex conversational flows, and orchestrating multiple agents.\n",
    "# More details about Runners, Sessions, and advanced event processing are coming up in later tutorials—stay tuned!"
